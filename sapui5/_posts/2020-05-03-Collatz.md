# SAP Community Coding Challenge - 2

## The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 

- If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. 

- If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. 

The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.[More Details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

Altough I don't see any practical applications to the **Collatz Conjecture**. Let's see, what this conjecture offers.
<br><br>Collatz Conjecture is given by,
$$
    f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n/2,  & \text{if $n$ is even} \\[2ex]
3n+1, & \text{if $n$ is odd}
\end{cases}
$$

I have written the code in python as well, to actually visualize the data which is provided by Conjecture. Python has libraries which makes the plotting of 2D graph much easier.

```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def collatze(i):
    count = 0

    while i > 1:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            i = i // 2
        else:
            i = (3 * i) + 1
        count = count + 1

    return count


limit = 1000

y = np.zeros(limit, dtype=int)
x = np.arange(limit, dtype=int)

for n in x:
    y[n] = collatze(x[n])

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y, '.', ms=4)

plt.show()


```
