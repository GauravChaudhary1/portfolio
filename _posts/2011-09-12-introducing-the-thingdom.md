I'm very excited to finally unveil what I've been working on for the past few months! I'll start with the story.

When I decided to leave Microsoft, I realized that I'd need a new computer. Having experienced Apple hardware in the past, I knew that I wanted a Mac; the question was simply which one.

I spent time researching the various models and specs, but ultimately, I wanted more "human" data. I thus wrote up an (admittedly long) email to the subset of my friends who I knew had a Mac, asking them which ones they had and how they liked them.

Among those on the "To:" line of my email was my close friend and peer, [Daniel Gasienica](http://gasi.ch/). Daniel is a big Apple fan (to say the least), so I valued his opinions in particular.

Surprisingly, answering my email wasn't a chore for Daniel; he *wanted* to tell me what he had and what he thought, because he loved Apple and identified with their products. This was equally the case with my other friends, as well.

Stepping back, these were two sides of the same coin: I wanted to *see* what my friends had, and my friends wanted to *share* what they had. We had no other place to do these things, so we resorted to email.

People resorted to email for sharing photos, too, before Facebook and Flickr came along.

So this is what Daniel and I have been working on: building a place for people to connect around the things in their lives. We're excited to finally share it publicly today; we call it **[The Thingdom](http://www.thethingdom.com/)**.

So check it out, join ([follow me](http://www.thethingdom.com/aseemk) once you do) and tell us where you think we should go with this! We're just getting started.

The Thingdom wouldn't be nearly what it is today without the contributions of several amazing people. For starters, [Sanjay Kumar](http://www.twitter.com/sanjayvc) and [Sergio Haro](http://www.hungrybear.org/about/) contributed significantly to our original ideas and prototypes. Along the way, our beta users provided invaluable feedback (among the most prolific were [Boris Bluntschli](http://www.thethingdom.com/424f), [Gerd Zellweger](http://www.thethingdom.com/gz) and [Frida Kumar](http://www.thethingdom.com/frida)), and our friends and family provided equally invaluable support and encouragement. And last but definitely not least, [Daniel Gasienica](http://www.thethingdom.com/gasi) brought the whole idea to life, and so much more. Thanks, everyone.
