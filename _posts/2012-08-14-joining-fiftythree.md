Eighteen months ago, I left Microsoft to start [The Thingdom][thingdom].
That journey officially ended this week, and a new one has begun.

After months of keeping it under wraps, I'm thrilled to finally share that my
friends at [FiftyThree][] have [acquired][] The Thingdom, and I've [joined
them][] to transform our technology into something new.

When we met, they joked that they wanted to turn "The Thingdom" into "The
Ideadom" --- a place to connect people around ideas and help them grow.
That's what we're building now, and I couldn't be more excited.

We're just getting started, and if you're interested in being a part of it,
reach out --- [we're hiring][jobs]. Let's invent the future together.

There's much more I can say, but let me end it here for now and just say
thanks to everyone who helped along the way. Your support was invaluable, and
I couldn't have done it without you.

One journey ends, and another begins. So it goes...
