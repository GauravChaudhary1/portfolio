Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">More Details</a></h1>
