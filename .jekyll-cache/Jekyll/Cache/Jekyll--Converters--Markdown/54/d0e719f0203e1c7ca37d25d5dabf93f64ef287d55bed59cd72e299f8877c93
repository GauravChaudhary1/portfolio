<p>These questions are already out there on various platforms like leetcode, however, to find solutions in ABAP is quite hard for such problems.<br />
I am trying my hands on the solutions on ABAP or HANA for these as these questions are situation based. <br />
My objective would be to solve with minimal coding as much as possible.

Given 2 tables, a manager table and an employee table, query to get all Managers who have at least one male &amp; one female employee reporting to him.</h2>

<p>This is a very simple question to begin with. I will be using aggregation functions for calculating employees under a manager.</p>
