<p><a href="#5">5</a>
These questions are already out there on various platforms like leetcode, however, to find solutions in ABAP is quite hard for such problems.<br />
I am trying my hands on the solutions on ABAP or HANA for these as these questions are situation based. <br />
My objective would be to solve with minimal coding as much as possible.
